# MariaDB JDBC for Fabric and Forge

MariaDB JDBC driver for use as an external library/optional dependency by other projects.

* This mod doesn't do anything by itself - but it can be used by other mods that need JDBC.
* This mod is a direct repackage of the [official MariaDB connector](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/) with added mod metadata to allow it to be loaded on Fabric and Forge.
* There are no modifications to the underlying JDBC driver.

This mod is a universal JAR and should work on all Fabric and Forge versions.
